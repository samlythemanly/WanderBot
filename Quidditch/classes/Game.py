    Game manager. Keeps track of everything.
    Discord Quidditch is a turn-based game. Each turn has the following phases in order:
        1. Upkeep Phase:
            - Resolve all actions from the previous turn in order.
            - Apply / Remove trait modifiers
            - Generate list of players who can perform actions this turn
            - Announce results of previous turn
            - [optional] Announce information about the Snitch.
        2. Action Phase:
            - During this phase, players have a chance to attempt an action that will get resolved next turn.
            - Actions must be valid
        3. End Turn Phase:
            - Decrement action cooldowns
            - Clean up and get ready for the next turn.
